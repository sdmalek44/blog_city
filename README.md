# Blog City

Blog City was created as a personalized blog website. A blogger can log in as an admin and post articles for people to see. The admin can also label blogs with different categories so when a user goes to the site they can click on a category and be presented with all of the blogs that have that category. A blog can fall in more than one category. The website also allows users to register and leave comments on a blog. The admin has the ability to create edit or delete blogs, categories, and comments while a regular user only has the ability to edit/delete their own comment. This project gave me a chance to explore different levels of permissions given to users on a website. I gained some practice in using namespacing for admin and default user permissions. This project also allowed me hone my skills utilizing postgreSQL database table relationships. I challenged myself to not use any css framework to gain more experience using css.
